# iExpense

This is Project 7 of 100 days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/iexpense-introduction)). This project is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs.

As usual, there will be three challenges after the guided part of this tutorial project that I will implement myself in separate commits.

## Challenges

**Challenge #1**: Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars.

**Challenge #2**: Modify the expense amounts in ContentView to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under $10 should have one style, expenses under $100 another, and expenses over $100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you.

**Challenge #3**: For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted!
