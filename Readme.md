# iExpense

This is Project 7 of 100 days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/iexpense-introduction)). This project is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs.

As usual, there will be three challenges after the guided part of this tutorial project that I will implement myself in separate commits.
